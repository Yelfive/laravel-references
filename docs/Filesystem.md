# Storage path

- Storage is set by calling `\Illuminate\Foundation\Application::useStoragePath()`
- If the method above is not called, the 
    `$this->basePath . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'storage'` (@see `\Illuminate\Foundation\Application::storagePath()`)will be used
    and the `$this->basePath` is defined by calling 
    `new \Illuminate\Foundation\Application($basePath)`

# Store uploaded file

### Store uploaded file with random name

**Usage**
```
$request->file('file_name')->store($relativePathToRoot, $options = []);
```
**Description**

- The name is a unique hash generated by Laravel

- The extension of the file is determined by its mime type

- `$relativePathToRoot` above is a directory relative to `root` of the filesystem

- `root` is defined in `config/filesystems.php` with key `disks.local.root`

    ```config/filesystems.php
        'default' => 'local',
        'disks' => [
            'local' => [
                'driver' => 'local',
                'root' => storage_path('app'), // <--- HERE
            ],
            'public' => [
                'driver' => 'local',
                'root' => storage_path('app/public'),
                'url' => env('APP_URL').'/storage',
                'visibility' => 'public',
            ],
        ]
    ```

In case you have noticed the key `default` in the config array.
It is the disk used for store your files.

**Options**
If you want to store in disk other than default,
just define the disk config array in `disks`, say `public`.
Then use it like this:
```
$request->file('file_name')->store('avatar', ['disk' => 'public']);
```
Notice the `public` above, it specify which config array to apply

**Real Path**
It's a bit complicated to get a stored file's real path. Let's see
```
$storedName = $request->file('avatar')->store('image/avatar');
if ($storedName === false) {
    \\ throw something
}
$realPath = Storage::disk()->getDriver()->getAdapter()->applyPathPrefix($storedName);
```
